#Automobile Sales Analysis During Recession and Non-Recession Periods

This project explores the impact of economic factors such as recessions, unemployment rates, seasonality, consumer confidence, and advertising expenditure on automobile sales. Using historical data, this analysis uncovers insights about sales patterns during recession and non-recession periods.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to examine how different macroeconomic and seasonal factors influence automobile sales. Through a series of data visualizations and statistical analyses, we delve into:

Year-to-year fluctuations in automobile sales.
Sales patterns during recessions versus non-recession periods.
The effect of seasonality and unemployment rates on automobile sales.
The relationship between consumer confidence and sales.
How advertising expenditure varies by vehicle type during different economic conditions.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project is historical_automobile_sales.csv, which contains historical automobile sales data, including the following columns:

Year: The year of the sales data.
Automobile_Sales: The number of automobiles sold.
Vehicle_Type: The category of vehicle (e.g., sedan, truck, SUV).
Recession: A binary indicator (1 for recession years, 0 for non-recession years).
GDP: The Gross Domestic Product of the year.
Unemployment_Rate: The unemployment rate during the given year.
Consumer_Confidence: A measure of consumer confidence.
Advertising_Expenditure: The amount spent on advertising.
Price: The average price of the vehicle.

Project Structure

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The project begins by loading the dataset and performing basic exploratory data analysis to understand the variables and clean the data.
Yearly Sales Trends: We analyze fluctuations in automobile sales over the years and identify significant trends, especially during recession periods.
Sales Patterns During Recessions: The project investigates how automobile sales vary during economic recessions compared to non-recession periods, broken down by vehicle type.
Seasonality Impact: We examine how different months of the year (seasonality) affect automobile sales.
Relationship between Unemployment, Consumer Confidence, and Sales: This section looks at the correlation between unemployment rates, consumer confidence
